## Objective 1 - Data Preparation

**Status:** Completed

**Details:**
- Raw data loading, initial cleaning, top-100 product selection, daily aggregation, and time series feature generation have been successfully implemented and integrated into the `src/pipeline.py`.
- The processed data is saved to `data/processed/top100_daily.parquet` and the list of top product IDs to `data/processed/top100_ids.json`.
- Numeric features have been scaled using `StandardScaler` and saved to `models/scalers/`.
- The data has been temporally split into train, validation, and test sets, and saved as `train_scaled.parquet`, `val_scaled.parquet`, and `test_scaled.parquet` respectively in `data/processed/`.

**Optimality Assessment:**
- The data preparation pipeline is now fully implemented as per the requirements of Objective 1. It is modular, reproducible, and handles large datasets efficiently using Polars. The temporal split ensures proper evaluation for time-series data, and feature scaling prepares the data for DRL agents.

## Objective 2 â€” Define the MDP and implement the simulation environment

**Status:** Completed

**Details:**
- Design decisions for action type (discrete), reward formulation (revenue), and demand simulator (parametric log-linear elasticity model) have been made and configured in `config.yaml`.
- The OpenAI Gym compatible environment `src/envs/price_env.py` has been implemented, including `reset`, `step`, `render`, and `seed` methods.
- The `src/envs/simulators.py` file contains the `ParametricDemandSimulator` class.
- The environment successfully runs a full episode with a random policy without NaNs or unexpected negative rewards.
- A sanity check confirmed that increasing price tends to reduce predicted demand, validating the demand simulator.

**Optimality Assessment:**
- The simulation environment is now functional and meets the requirements of Objective 2. It provides a stable and configurable platform for training DRL agents.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with Objective 3: Implement and train DRL agents (DQN and PPO).
