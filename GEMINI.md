## Objective 1 - Data Preparation

**Status:** Completed

**Details:**
- Raw data loading, initial cleaning, top-100 product selection, daily aggregation, and time series feature generation have been successfully implemented and integrated into the `src/pipeline.py`.
- The processed data is saved to `data/processed/top100_daily.parquet` and the list of top product IDs to `data/processed/top100_ids.json`.
- Numeric features have been scaled using `StandardScaler` and saved to `models/scalers/`.
- The data has been temporally split into train, validation, and test sets, and saved as `train_scaled.parquet`, `val_scaled.parquet`, and `test_scaled.parquet` respectively in `data/processed/`.

**Optimality Assessment:**
- The data preparation pipeline is now fully implemented as per the requirements of Objective 1. It is modular, reproducible, and handles large datasets efficiently using Polars. The temporal split ensures proper evaluation for time-series data, and feature scaling prepares the data for DRL agents.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with Objective 2: Define the MDP and implement the simulation environment.
