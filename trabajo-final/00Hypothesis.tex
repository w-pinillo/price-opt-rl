\chapter{Problem Statement}
In the retail industry, the rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms and real-time price comparison tools has intensified competition, making pricing decisions increasingly critical to maintaining profitability and competitiveness. Many retailers still rely on static or rule-based pricing strategies that lack the flexibility to adapt to complex, rapidly changing market dynamics. These limitations often result in suboptimal revenue and margin performance, particularly in highly competitive and price-sensitive markets. Furthermore, despite the growing availability of extensive transactional and customer-level data, most retailers fail to effectively leverage these resources to develop adaptive, data-driven pricing strategies. Recent advances in reinforcement learning have demonstrated strong potential for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, providing a framework well suited to pricing problems that require continuous adaptation to fluctuating demand and evolving market conditions. Nevertheless, the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to dynamic price optimization remains limited, despite its ability to exploit large-scale retail data for adaptive policy learning. This gap underscores the need to design, implement, and evaluate a DRL-based framework capable of learning optimal pricing policies through interaction with a simulated retail environment, with the objective of maximizing profitability and operational efficiency.
